    <p>In our school, a scout engages in a variety of activities designed to promote personal development, teamwork, 
        and community service.  Scouts focus on learning to set goals, overcome challenges, and
         develop a strong moral compass. Scouts frequently engage in outdoor activities like camping trips, hiking, and 
         nature exploration.</p>
