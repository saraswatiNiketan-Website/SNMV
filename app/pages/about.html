Established in 2004 B.S. Saraswati Niketan has served the nation well in terms of spreading the light of education and producing eligible human resources in different fields. The school was initiated by a local lad of ‘Jyapu’ community to educate the young boys of his community in a congested room on the ground floor of his home. When the number of students increased, it moved from place to place and finally landed at its present location which was a falcha (inn) in front of Shesh Narayan Temple. With more than 7 decades of glorious history, the school recently celebrated its 75th anniversary. In the changing scenario, the school is trying to adapt new pedagogies to inculcate 21st-century skills in the students. 
Situated in a Newar community, the rich tangible and intangible cultural heritage are just next door, which provide students with living examples of the things they study in their textbooks and ample opportunities for the students to learn through social interaction. The school is now adopting culturally responsive pedagogy as the school's signature pedagogy to use those cultural heritages adopting the progressive pedagogy in the teaching and learning process. With programs such as Computer Engineering from grade 9 to 12, we are promoting technical education. Implementing an integrated curriculum and portfolio-based assessment are some of the innovative programs going on in her school. With less than 4 aana land the school maintains its greenery through bottle gardening. The mobilization of the eco club and integrating bottle gardening with curriculum and assessment are some of the attempts to ensure the sustainability of this green school program.
With the passing time we are launching new programs to meet the changing needs of society. Our main concern is our students and their holistic development and secured future!
